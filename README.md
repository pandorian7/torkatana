# TorKatana

**inspired by [librorrent](https://www.libtorrent.org/)**

This tool can be used to seperate downloaded (or partially downloaded) torrents into fixed sized block and reconnect them later.

> _Slice torrents like a samurai_

Personally used to download large games as blocks in cloud VMs and join them later in the PC.

## Features ðŸŒƒ

- Access basic information about the torrent.
  - Name
  - Number of Files
  - Seperate file into
  - Number of Pieces
  - Piece checksums
  - Total size
- Generate and parse block file names for given pattern
- Map Block (Identify a byterange in the torrent from files) `[from libtorrent]`
- Map File (Identify a file or a file slice in the torrent) `[from libtorrent]`
- Verify the torrent integrity
- Read a piece by index

## Usage

> for the purpose of demonstrating I will use [Death's Door by FitGirl Repacks](https://fitgirl-repacks.site/deaths-door/)

### Basic Setup

```python
from torkatana import Torrent

torrent_path = "Death's Door [FitGirl Repack].torrent"

tor = Torrent(torrent_path)
```

### Access Basic Info

```python
tor.path # path to torrent file
tor.name  # Death's Door [FitGirl Repack]
tor.numFiles # 10
tor.numPieces # 1117
tor.pieceLength # 524288 (in bytes) = 512 kB
tor.pieceSize(1116) # 300357 (same as pieceLength except for the last piece)
tor.pieceRange # range(0, 1117)
tor.totalSize # 585405765 (in bytes) = 558.2 MB

tor.files
# (File(index=0, path='fg-01.bin', size=298029043, offset=0), ...)
tor.fileRange # range(0, 10)
tor.getFile(0) # get a specific file
# File(index=0, path='fg-01.bin', size=298029043, offset=0)

tor.hashes # SHA-1 checksums of each piece of the torrent as a string tuple
# ('9c6fd4ef4bcdcb8c38af3917253883e2f2c3b69e', '374bb5b90420f543d8e5aaaa2e59cd4baad302fd', ... )
```

### `mapFile(file_index, file_offset, size)`

> this function was extracted from libtorrent

```python
# file_index := required
# file_offset := defaults to 0
# file_size := defaults to file size

# can be used to to map a file in the torrent

tor.mapFile(2)
# TorrentSlice(first_index=957, first_offset=141401, first_size=382887, jumps=121, last_size=118065)

# first_index := index of the piece that the files begins
# first_offset := file begining position relative to the begining of the piece
# first_size := amount of file content in the first piece
# jupms := number of whole pieces occupied by the file after the first piece
# last_size := amount of file content in the last piece of the range
```

### `mapBlock(piece_index, piece_offset, size, dynamic_size: bool)`

> this function was extracted from libtorrent

```python
# piece_index := required
# piece_offset := defaults to 0
# size := defaults to the pieceLength, can be set to a larget value
# dynamic_size := if set true, when offset + size > totalSize, the size variable is modified such that about conditions is true, if dynamic size is false in such situation programe will raise an error

# can be used to map a piece range to a file range

tor.mapBlock(568) # for this torrey piece 568 is special. it's the piece that contains the last part of the file 0 and the starting part of the file 1. as shown below

# (FileSlice(file_index=0, offset=297795584, size=233459), FileSlice(file_index=1, offset=0, size=290829))
```

### Secondary Setup

This is requred to acces the extended features of the module

#### Physical Path

```python
physical_path = "Downloads/Death's Door [FitGirl Repack]" # this is where downloaded files are stored
tor.setPhysicalPath(physical Path)

# now following options are available

tor.physicalPath
tor.absPathToFile(1)

# setting physical path is essential for beging able to access the actual torrent data in the disk
```

#### Block Details

```python
from torkatana.blocker import MB

blocks_path = "Downloads/bocks"
blocks_pattern = "deaths-door.{index}.fit-girl"
# index will we replaced with the block index and padded with zeros depending on the number of blocks

block_size = MB(100)
n_pieces_in_block = int(block_size/tor.pieceLength)
tor.setNPiecesInBlock(n_pieces_in_block)
tor.setBlocksPath(blocks_path)
tor.setBlockPattern(blocks_pattern)

# now following options are available

tor.blocksPath
tor.absPathToBlock(2)
tor.blockRange
tor.blockSize
tor.blockPattern
tor.blockSize
tor.numPiecesInBlock
tor.getBlockName(3) # "deaths-door.03.fit-girl"
tor.parseBlockName("deaths-door.03.fit-girl") # 3
```

### Using ClI Tool

```
usage: torkatana [-h] [--physical PHYSICAL] [--blocks BLOCKS] [--blocks-pattern PATTERN] [--block-size BLOCK_SIZE]
                 torrent {tverify,bverify,merge} ...

A CLI tool for managing torrents.

positional arguments:
  torrent               The path to the torrent file.
  {tverify,bverify,merge}
    tverify             Verify the torrent.
    bverify             Verify the blocks.
    merge               Merge the blocks.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --physical PHYSICAL   The path to the physical files.
  --blocks BLOCKS       The path to the blocks.
  --blocks-pattern PATTERN
                        The pattern for the blocks.
  --block-size BLOCK_SIZE
                        The size of the blocks.
```

The CLI tool can be used to,

- verity the torrent
- verity the blocks
- merge the blocks into the original torrent

#### CLI Tool Examples

```

To merge the blocks into original files

python -m torkatana --blocks "moon-mystery fit-girl" --blocks-pattern "moon-mystery.{index}.fit-girl" --block-size 1G ".\Moon Mystery [FitGirl Repack].torrent" merge "./Moon Mystery Directory"
```

### Other Examples

```python
from torkatana.experimental import blockWriter, splitBlock

BlockIndex = 4


# to split the torrent into blocks
with blockWriter(tor) as writer:
    for _ in splitBlock(tor, BlockIndex, writer):
        pass

# ot split the torrent into blocks with a progress bar
with blockWriter(tor) as writer:
    for _ in tqdm(enumerate(splitBlock(tor, BlockIndex, writer)), desc=f"Creting Block {BlockIndex}", total=tor.numPiecesInBlock, unit="pcs", bar_format="{l_bar}{bar}| {n_fmt}/{total_fmt} [{remaining}]", colour='blue', ncols=100):
        pass
```
